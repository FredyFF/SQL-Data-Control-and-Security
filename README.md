# SQL-DATA-Control-and-Security

DCL which stands for Data Control Language. Basically, DCL statements are grouped with DML statements. So the commands in this command are useful for controlling database access rights (privileges) and manipulating database users. Commands included in the DCL group are GANT and REVOKE.

There are 2 types of security available:
	1. Server Logins: logins are created at the server level. By logging in, someone can access SQL Server Service
	2. Database Users: users are created at the database level. With users, someone can access every database on the service.
